# <Plan title>

## Context

**Shaping artefacts**
- Brief: `brief.md`
- Breadboard: `breadboard-pack.md`
- Risk register: `risk-register.md`
- Spikes: `spike-investigation.md` (if present)

## Overview

(What we are building, 4–8 bullets max)

## Problem / motivation

(Why this matters, link to evidence)

## Scope

**In scope**
- 

**Out of scope (cuts/out-of-bounds)**
- 

## Key flows

(Reference breadboard, then specify the flow(s) clearly)

## Key logic

(Rules, edge cases, constraints)

## Research & references

### Internal
- Similar implementations:
  - `path/to/file.ext:line`
- Repo conventions:
  - 
- Institutional learnings:
  - 

### External (if applicable)
- 

## Proposed solution

(High-level approach. Map back to breadboard parts.)

### Alternatives considered

1) Option A
- Pros:
- Cons:

2) Option B
- Pros:
- Cons:

## Implementation plan

### Phase 0: Preconditions
- [ ] 

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] 

### Phase 2: Core implementation
- [ ] 

### Phase 3: Polish + guardrails
- [ ] 

### Stop points

(Call out “pause and reassess” moments)

## Acceptance criteria

(Each criterion should be measurable)
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

## Verification plan

(Map to acceptance criteria)

## Non-functional requirements

- Performance:
- Reliability:
- Security/privacy:
- Accessibility (if UI):

## Dependencies & prerequisites

## Rollout / rollback

- Rollout strategy:
- Feature flags (if any):
- Migration strategy (if any):
- Rollback plan:

## Observability

- Dashboards:

## Risks & mitigations

(Pull from risk register, update as needed)

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Detection | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

## Open questions

(Should be empty or explicitly out-of-bounds before GO)

## Plan review notes (integrated)

(Only keep what’s still useful after applying changes)
