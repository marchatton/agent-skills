# Opportunity Solution Tree

## Inputs

- Target user.
- Target metric.
- Current problem evidence.
- Constraints and risks.

## Outputs

- Opportunity-solution tree (outline or diagram).
- Next experiment definition.

## Steps

1. State the target outcome metric.
2. List problems and opportunities.
3. Map solution ideas and experiments.
4. Mark the riskiest assumption and the next bet.

## Verification

- Target user, target metric, riskiest assumption, and next experiment are explicit.
