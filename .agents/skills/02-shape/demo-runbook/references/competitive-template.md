# Competitive Template (April Dunford style, respectful)

Use this template to write a short, credible competitive section. Focus on approaches, priorities, and trade-offs.

## Set the frame (10 to 15 seconds)
Say:
- “There are a few sensible ways to solve this. Most teams choose an approach based on what they optimise for.”

## Describe common market approaches (neutral)
Choose one or two patterns. Keep neutral language.

Pattern A: Speed and breadth
- What it looks like: fast responses, broad coverage, lighter grounding
- Why teams do it: optimises for adoption and quick time-to-value
- Trade-off: more variance in reliability and provenance

Pattern B: Workflow automation
- What it looks like: strict flows, deterministic steps, limited flexibility
- Why teams do it: optimises for repeatable processes and compliance
- Trade-off: less adaptable to messy questions and edge cases

Pattern C: Deep retrieval and provenance
- What it looks like: stronger grounding, citations, controlled outputs
- Why teams do it: optimises for trust and high-stakes usage
- Trade-off: more complexity and sometimes more latency

## Position competitors (if names provided)
If competitor names are provided, map them to patterns without judgement:
- “{{competitor_1}} tends to lean towards {{pattern}} because it optimises for {{priority}}.”
- “{{competitor_2}} leans towards {{pattern}}.”

If names are not provided, keep it generic:
- “Many competitors lean towards {{pattern}}.”

## Describe our approach and why (tie to user feelings)
Say:
- “We’re optimising for {{our_priority}}, because our user is trying to {{job_to_be_done}} while feeling {{starting_feelings}}.”
- “So we chose {{our_approach_summary}}.”

## Make trade-offs explicit
State:
- “Trade-off we accept: {{tradeoff_1}}.”
- “Trade-off we accept: {{tradeoff_2}}.”
- “Upside: {{upside}}.”

Close with:
- “It’s not ‘better’, it’s designed for different constraints.”

## Keep this out
Avoid:
- dunking
- claims you cannot evidence
- vague “AI magic” language
