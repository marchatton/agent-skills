# Risk register

> Keep this as the working list of rabbit holes + mitigations.

## Legend

**Mitigation moves**
- **Cut**: remove from scope
- **Patch**: simplify with a constraint/assumption
- **Spike**: proof required (run spike-investigation + oracle)
- **Out-of-bounds**: explicitly not handled

**Severity**
- P1: could sink or invalidate approach
- P2: meaningful risk, needs a plan
- P3: nice to address if cheap
