# wf-explore

## Purpose

Define the opportunity and next experiment before shaping.

## Inputs

- Problem context and target users.
- Current metrics or qualitative signals.
- Constraints and known risks.

## Outputs

- Docs artefacts saved per `docs/AGENTS.md` in the target repo (explore brief + next experiment required; optional supporting docs as needed).

## Steps

1. Define the work slug (prefer `0001_<short>` for ordering).
2. Draft the explore brief per `docs/AGENTS.md` (problems, opportunities, assumptions, next experiment).
3. Add optional segmentation/positioning/roadmap/pricing docs if needed.
4. Summarize the next experiment and expected learning.

## Verification

- Target user, target metric, riskiest assumption, and next experiment are explicit.

## Go/No-Go

- GO if the opportunity is scoped and the next bet is clear.
- NO-GO if it is a list without a testable next step.
