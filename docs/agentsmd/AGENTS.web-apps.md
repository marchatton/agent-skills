# Web app (apps/web)
Next.js App Router web application.

## Stack
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Radix (icons: `lucide-react`)
- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod
- Tests: Vitest + Testing Library (MSW for mocks)

## Guardrails (high leverage)
- Server-first: fetch on the server (RSC / route handlers / server actions). Avoid client-side data fetching effects.
- Treat `useEffect` as an escape hatch (imperative interop only) — not for data fetching, derived state, prop→state, or URL sync.
- Never import server-only into client components (use `server-only` / `client-only` boundaries).
- Validate external inputs with Zod and map errors to safe user-facing messages.
